## Predicting scalars with DP, in terms of atomic charge.

If we want to predict the charge for a large system, it will be time-consuming to perform DFT (density functional theory) calculations, and we can save machine time if we use neural networks to predict the atomic charge. In the following we will implement this in the [DeePMD](https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit) framework, but of course we can also implement the prediction for other atomic scalars.

## Steps to Train the Charge Model

1. **Calculate Hirshfeld Charges in CP2K**  
   Add the following keyword in your CP2K input file to enable Hirshfeld charge calculation:  
   [Hirshfeld keyword](https://github.com/Zhang-pchao/OilWaterInterface/blob/main/DFT_Calculation/cp2k_input/m062x/m062x.inp#L145)

2. **Build the Training Dataset**  
   Extract the charge data (`atom_dos.npy`) from the `cp2k.out.log` file using this script:  
   [sp_cp2k2dp_charge.py](https://github.com/Zhang-pchao/predict_atomic_charge/blob/main/cp2k_Hirshfeld/sp_cp2k2dp_charge.py)

3. **Train the Charge Model**  
   Train the model following the settings in:  
   [run.json](https://github.com/Zhang-pchao/predict_atomic_charge/blob/main/model/run.json)

4. **Predict the charge**
   - You can evaluate the model on a test set using the [dp test](https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/master/test/test.html) command as shown in the [Bohrium Notebook](https://bohrium.dp.tech/notebooks/6641686247). Note that youâ€™ll first need to prepare the test data by modifying the [lammps_trj2dp_charge.py](https://github.com/Zhang-pchao/OilWaterInterface/blob/main/Analysis_Scripts/charge/lammps_trj2dp_charge.py) script accordingly.
   - Another way is to use the [ASE interface](https://github.com/AxelTG/BaH2/blob/main/dp_charges/bader_predict.py), which allows direct prediction of atomic charges from structure files.

5. **More Information**  
   - For additional details, refer to the [DOS model manual](https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/master/model/train-fitting-dos.html), the [Bohrium Notebook](https://bohrium.dp.tech/notebooks/6641686247) and the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c05004).  
   - The charge model is a simplified case of the DOS model, where the charge model is one-dimensional.
